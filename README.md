Even based on a up-level rule, python program can decide which function to use according to business situation. It's a first step to make a robot for running Amazon stores, as far as it can do.
Go as far as codes can do .

Structure Scheme:


-Nature Language Layer

  --Stragety
  
  --Operation rules
  
  --Conflicts Resolution
  
-Codes layer

  --Manually analyze "Nature Language Layer" to change it to codes
  
  --LLM analyzes "Nature Language Layer" to change it to codes.
  
  -- Human in loop to adjust codes by analyzing Nature Language Layer
  
-interface

  --interface to Python Program
  
  --interface to machine learning
  
  --interface to LLM 
  
  --interface to production software for other programing language.
